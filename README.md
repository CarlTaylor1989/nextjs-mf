# Getting started

You will need to go into each micro frontend application (home, checkout & locations) and run`npm install` to install their dependencies.

You can run a single micro frontend by running `npm run dev`.
Or run them all at the root directory and run `npm run start` - this will run each app for their respective ports.

Home app `:3000`
Checkout app `:3001`
Locations app `:3002`

After all the apps are up & running you can access http://localhost:3000 and be able to navigate between each apps.
